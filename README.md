Chrome Extension to bypass Medium Paywall




The user will be able to input a list of websites(generally ones which have limited usage and paywalls) into the options of the extension.


When the user navigates to one of these sites, the extension will automatically open the same url in an incognito tab in order to bypass the monthly articles requirement.
