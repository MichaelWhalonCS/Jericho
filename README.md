Chrome Extension to bypass blog paywalls.

Release 0: YOU ARE HERE
When on any url that contains "medium.com", click the extension in order to open an incognito tab of the same url

Release 1:
The user will be able to input a list of websites(generally ones which have limited usage and paywalls) into the options of the extension.


When the user navigates to one of these sites, the extension will automatically open the same url in an incognito tab in order to bypass the monthly articles requirement.
